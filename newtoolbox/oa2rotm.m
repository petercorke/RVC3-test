%OA2ROTM Convert orientation and approach vectors to rotation matrix
%
% R = OA2ROTM(O, A) is an SO(3) rotation matrix (3x3) for the specified
% orientation and approach vectors (3x1) formed from 3 vectors such that R
% = [N O A] and N = O x A.
%
% Notes::
% - The matrix is guaranteed to be orthonormal so long as O and A 
%   are not parallel.
% - The vectors O and A are parallel to the Y- and Z-axes of the coordinate
%   frame respectively.
