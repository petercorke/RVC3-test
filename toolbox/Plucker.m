%Plucker Create 3D line using Plucker coordinates
%
% Class to represent a 3D line using Plucker coordinates.
%
% P = Plucker(P1, P2) creates a Plucker object that represents
% the line joining the 3D points P1 (1x3) and P2 (1x3). The direction
% is from P2 to P1.
%
% P = Plucker(X) creates a Plucker object from X (1x6) = [W,V] where
% W (3x1) is the line direction and V (3x1) is the moment.
%
% P = Plucker(L) creates a copy of the Plucker object L.
%
% Methods:
% closest          - closest point on line
