%RandomDriver Vehicle driver class
%
% Create a "driver" object capable of steering a Vehicle subclass object through random
% waypoints within a rectangular region and at constant Speed.
%
% The driver object is connected to a Vehicle object by the latter's
% addDriver() method.  The driver's demand() method is invoked on every
% call to the Vehicle's step() method.
%
% Methods::
%  init       reset the random number generator
%  demand     Speed and steer angle to next waypoint
%  display    display the state and parameters in human readable form
%  char       convert to string
%plot
% Properties::
%  Goal          current Goal/waypoint coordinate
%  Vehicle           the Vehicle object being controlled
%  dim           dimensions of the work space (2x1) [m]
%  Speed         Speed of travel [m/s]
%  DistTresh       proximity to waypoint at which next is chosen [m]
%
% Example::
%
%    veh = Bicycle(V);
%    veh.addDriver( RandomDriver(20, 2) );
%
% Notes::
% - It is possible in some cases for the vehicle to move outside the desired
%   region, for instance if moving to a waypoint near the edge, the limited
%   turning circle may cause the vehicle to temporarily move outside.
% - The vehicle chooses a new waypoint when it is closer than property
%   closeenough to the current waypoint.
% - Uses its own random number stream so as to not influence the performance
%   of other randomized algorithms such as path planning.
