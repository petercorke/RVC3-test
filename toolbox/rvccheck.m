function rvccheck()

% this function is a help to users, and those providing help in forums to understand
% the users environment.  Peter's experience is that a mix of toolboxes and path issues
% is the root cause of a lot of problems.

% Checking installation for RVC3 toolbox

% report version of MATLAB
% warning if version is too old

% check for presence of RST, CVST and other required MW toolboxes
% error if key ones are missing
% warning if some functionality might be lost, ie. The toolboxes required for Part III are not present, you need ....

% check for presence of RTB, MVTB, SMTB
% it looks like you have the older MATLAB toolboxes installed...

% check for shadowing, or which toolboxes are first in the path
% it looks like some older toolboxes are shadowing this toolbox, do you want to automatically fix your MATLAB path...
